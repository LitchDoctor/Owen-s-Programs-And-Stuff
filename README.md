# Final Game

### By Litch Doctor

---

This is a game in which you are the ruler of a kingdom. You begin with 15 knights, and you must spend them on upgrades for the kingdom. These upgrades can do many things, from increasing your knight production to producing traps. Every round, you will be attacked by vikings. These vikings will enter battle with your knights, and it may result in you losing some of your knights.

## Gameplay

- You begin the game with 15 knights. There are four purchases available at the beginning of the game: Barracks, Weaponry, Trap Factory and Ra Mirror.  
- If you choose to buy something, you must type the option of what you wish to purchase (a, b, c, d, etc.) when you're prompted to buy something.  
- If you enter an invalid option, the shop will reload and you will be able to purchase something again.  
- To skip a purchase and proceed straight to battle, you can leave the input empty, and just press enter when prompted to buy something.  
- Both knights and vikings have effectiveness levels. These are taken into account when they are in battle. A higher knight effectiveness means your knights will defeat more vikings. The same is true for viking effectiveness.  
- The number of vikings you face in battle is partially dependent on how many knights you currently have, but it also increases over time.  
- The game will continue until all of your knights have been slain.
